          Mercury is the smallest planet and closest to the Sun. It has no
          atmosphere, extreme temperature changes, and a cratered, rocky
          surface. Despite its proximity to the Sun, it's not the hottest
          planet. A day on Mercury lasts longer than its year due to its slow
          rotation.

        Venus is similar in size to Earth but has a thick, toxic atmosphere rich
        in carbon dioxide. Its surface is extremely hot due to the greenhouse
        effect, making it the hottest planet. Venus rotates slowly and in the
        opposite direction of most planets, and it's often called Earth's twin.

          Earth is the only known planet to support life. It has liquid water, a
          breathable atmosphere, and diverse ecosystems. Earth's surface is
          dynamic with continents, oceans, and weather systems. The planet
          orbits the Sun once a year and rotates every 24 hours, giving us day
          and night cycles.

        Mars, the red planet, is known for its iron-rich soil and dry,
        desert-like surface. It has the largest volcano and canyon in the solar
        system. Mars has seasons, polar ice caps, and signs of ancient water
        flow, sparking interest in its potential to support past or future life.

        Jupiter is the largest planet, a gas giant with a powerful magnetic
        field and dozens of moons. It's famous for the Great Red Spot, a giant
        storm. Jupiter's atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium, with colorful
        cloud bands and extreme weather. Its immense gravity influences many
        objects in space.

        Saturn is best known for its stunning ring system, composed of ice and
        rock particles. It's a gas giant like Jupiter, with a low density and
        strong winds. Saturn has over 100 moons, including Titan, which has a
        thick atmosphere. The planet's beauty and complexity continue to
        fascinate astronomers.

        Uranus is an ice giant with a pale blue color due to methane in its
        atmosphere. It rotates on its side, possibly due to a past collision,
        leading to unusual seasons. The planet has faint rings and over two
        dozen moons. It's cold, distant, and mysterious in many ways.

        Neptune is the farthest known planet, dark blue due to atmospheric
        methane. It's an ice giant with supersonic winds and violent storms.
        Neptune has faint rings and many moons, including Triton, which orbits
        backward. Though distant, it's a dynamic world full of energy and motion
        beneath its icy clouds.
